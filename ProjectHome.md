Zephyr Open is a code project to provide a framework for BlueTooth Physiological Sensors. Heart rate Monitors and Wii Remotes are obvous starting point, but we will continue to grow the device list as they enter the market. What kind of [mashups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)) can you envision? Games for rehab? distributed game play? virtual coaching?

With the framework is a simple SWING Application to search and connect to Zephyr products. Users can connect devices and view reports in real time. This data can also be streamed to the web via FTP or directly into your gmail account via ATOM feeds.

We will be releasing **Free** [VO2max testing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqbtcjXDxto&feature=related) and [Estimation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PnLA1bRuI) software for OSX, PC and cell phones. You can edit, graph and export your data from the Google Documents web application. _Totally free to stream your data and do basic fitness tests, but full featured applications will be licensed._ This also is a perfect tool for education and several masters students have contributed with suggestions and bug reports.

Example of a connected HXM showing reports in a SWING window on OSX, but because the graphing is done by google.. any sized screen can be accommodated. Further, because the communication is HTTP, there are no issues with firewalls or NAT.

[GData Spread Sheet Limits](http://groups.google.com/group/GDSupdates/browse_thread/thread/4efdc836277ebea4#) These features are being worked on right now. Soon you can simply stream right into a public web document.
