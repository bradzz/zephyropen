# Introduction #

SVN access with Eclipse requires that you install a subversion plugin. Do this from the Eclipse market place under 'Help' menu. Search for 'SVN', and choose Subclipse (are others plugins that work too). You will need to restart Eclipse after doing a "find updates" as well.

# Creating an SVN repository #

To get the code from SVN, choose File -> New -> Other, then SVN (as seen below).
